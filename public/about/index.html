    <h1>About Mier</h1>

    

    <p>I am Mieraisan Mieraidihaimu (AKA Mier), and a Minority Chinese grow up in china. I've joined the Cookpad as aniOS Engineer here in Bristol, UK.</p>
<p>As an Uzbek &amp; Uyghur mixed ethnic, I have lived in a society which contain Chinese culture, Turk culture as well as influence of Western Philosophy. If I can recall my childhood, I have been influence by the scientific movies, TV show and develop my undivided motivation to computer world.</p>
<p>After graduating from University in china, I've decided to pursue my education as well as life dream, and look for opportunities in Europe. Luckily I have got accepted in one of the Finnish Technology Company, I started new life in Finland. Finland brought me too much, education, job opportunities as well as unforgettable memories.</p>
<p>After accomplishing 5 years career and studied in Finland, I chased fastest growing sight in Shanghai, China. Unarguably, Tech rising star China had too much to offer people and communities without disclosing their giant growing market. I worked in one of the giant corporate Ping'An as a Senior Engineer to develop their Fin-tech Realestate Digital World. Then coming up a fascinated opportunity in Leading Luxury E-commerce Platform Farfetch Ltd. Their ambition was to create tailored platform for serving fastest growing unpredictable Chinese customers. I have learn and grow while help the company achieve their mission with my little help.</p>
<p>Despite of above briefly-mentioned life journey, I have never lost the intimacy with cooking. Even though I cannot cook great dishes to serve others, I felt comfortable and accomplished every time I cooked. When the opportunity in Cookpad come across me, I have really excited and grateful about this, and decided to relocate to Bristol to join Cookpad Family.</p>
