I am Mieraisan Mieraidihaimu (AKA Mier), and a Minority Chinese grow up in china. I've joined the Cookpad as aniOS Engineer here in Bristol, UK.

As an Uzbek & Uyghur mixed ethnic, I have lived in a society which contain Chinese culture, Turk culture as well as influence of Western Philosophy. If I can recall my childhood, I have been influence by the scientific movies, TV show and develop my undivided motivation to computer world.

After graduating from University in china, I've decided to pursue my education as well as life dream, and look for opportunities in Europe. Luckily I have got accepted in one of the Finnish Technology Company, I started new life in Finland. Finland brought me too much, education, job opportunities as well as unforgettable memories.

After accomplishing 5 years career and studied in Finland, I chased fastest growing sight in Shanghai, China. Unarguably, Tech rising star China had too much to offer people and communities without disclosing their giant growing market. I worked in one of the giant corporate Ping'An as a Senior Engineer to develop their Fin-tech Realestate Digital World. Then coming up a fascinated opportunity in Leading Luxury E-commerce Platform Farfetch Ltd. Their ambition was to create tailored platform for serving fastest growing unpredictable Chinese customers. I have learn and grow while help the company achieve their mission with my little help.

Despite of above briefly-mentioned life journey, I have never lost the intimacy with cooking. Even though I cannot cook great dishes to serve others, I felt comfortable and accomplished every time I cooked. When the opportunity in Cookpad come across me, I have really excited and grateful about this, and decided to relocate to Bristol to join Cookpad Family.
